# Intro
Hand gesture recognition aims to identify the meaning that the signer wants to express based on the gestures made. With the human hand as the input device of computer, the communication between human and machine will no longer need special medium, but users can simply define a series of appropriate gestures to control surrounding machines.

Hand Gesture Recognition can be used for many things:
•	It can be used to teach children how to count easily.
•	Help people who are mute to communicate.
•	In smart homes to operate various electronic devices just by waving your hand.
•	It can be a useful tool in this pandemic era to work in a contactless manner.
•	It makes the work convenient and faster.
•	It has many different applications in different industries.


# Steps needed to perform Hand Gesture Recognition

1) Read the image
2) Preprocess on image: - Resizing, Grayscale and Blurring Image
                                             Original Image
                                             Gray scale image
                                             Inverted gray scale image
                                             Gaussian blur image
                                             Inverted Gaussian Blur Image
                                             Pencil sketch = Gray image

# Libraries needed to install for Image Processing
Pip install opencv-python


3) Computing the Contour 
Contour Detection is the process of joining all the continuous points along the boundary having the same color intensity.
Contour Detection is a useful method for shape analysis in object detection and recognition
It is mainly used to determine the shape of closed objects
Contour detection is carries out only for detecting the objects in the image

4) Find the convex hull and convexity defects

5) Detection of fingers

6) Deploy your project using flask
